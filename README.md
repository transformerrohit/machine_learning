Machine Learning using Python


## Machine Learning Concepts

### Categories

- Supervised - The Computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
- Unsupervised - No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself like discovering hidden patterns in data or feature engineering.
- Reinforcement Learning - A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal. Such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent. The program is provided with feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its probem space.

### Types

- Regression - A supervised problem, the outputs are continuous.
Types - 
- Linear (Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression), 
- Linear/Non-Linear (Polynomial Regression), 
- Non-Linear (Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression)

- Classification - Inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way.
Types - 
- Linear (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)),
- Linear/Non-Linear (Naive Bayes),
- Non-Linear (K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Kernel SVM, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification) 

- Clustering - A set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.
Types - K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering

- Density Estimation - Finds the distribution os inputs in some space.
- Dimensionality Reduction - Simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space.
