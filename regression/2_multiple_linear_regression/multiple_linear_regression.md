### Multiple Linear Regression Intuition & Code Explanation

**y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + ... + bn*xn**  
where, y = Dependent Variable (DV) (Something which we are trying to explain)  
       b0 = Constant  
       b1, b2, b3, ..., bn = Co-efficient of DV  
       x1, x2, x3, ..., xn = Independent Variable (IV) (Sometimes IV may be direct cause of change in DV, sometimes it may be not)  
In Simple Linear Regression there is only one IV
